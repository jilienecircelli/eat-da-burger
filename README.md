# Eat-da-burger

This project was created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. In addition, the app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. Overall, this app was fun and enjoyable to work on and helped me hone in on newly learned coding skills. The app doesn't fully follow the design template as I added a slightly different functionality to the app. While in the instructions the demo doesnt allow the user to change the status of the burger once it has been devoured, my app allows the user to toggle the burger between uneaten and devoured. The app itself could be improved with the addition of DELETE functionality which would allow the user to not only to remove a created burger from the screen but also from the database behind the scenes.
